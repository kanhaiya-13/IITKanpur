## ðŸ”§ **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- **Models**: User, Conversation, OnboardingFlowConfig, OnboardingProgress
- **Services**: AI Service with intent recognition, entity extraction, sentiment analysis
- **Routes**: Auth, Conversations, Onboarding Flows, Users
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live chat

### **Frontend (Next.js + React)**
- **Pages**: Dashboard, Chat, Onboarding Flows, Auth
- **Context**: Authentication, Socket connection
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design

### **Database (MongoDB)**
- **Collections**: Users, Conversations, OnboardingFlowConfigs, OnboardingProgress
- **Indexes**: Optimized for performance

## ðŸŽ¨ **Customization**

### **Creating New Flows**
You can create new onboarding flows by:

1. **Using the API**:
```javascript
POST /api/onboarding-flows/flows
{
  "flowId": "insurance_application",
  "flowName": "Insurance Application",
  "flowDescription": "Complete insurance application process",
  "welcomeMessage": "Welcome to our insurance application process!",
  "completionMessage": "Your insurance application has been submitted!",
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepId": "personal_info",
      "stepName": "Personal Information",
      "stepType": "data_collection",
      "fields": [
        {
          "fieldId": "name",
          "fieldName": "Full Name",
          "fieldType": "text",
          "prompt": "What's your full name?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Database Direct**: Add to `OnboardingFlowConfig` collection

### **Field Types Supported**
- `text`: Free text input
- `email`: Email validation
- `phone`: Phone number validation
- `date`: Date extraction
- `number`: Numeric input
- `select`: Multiple choice options

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Hackathon!**

The system is now **fully functional** and ready for your hackathon presentation! It demonstrates:

âœ… **Configurable conversational agent framework**  
âœ… **Natural language interaction**  
âœ… **Step-by-step data collection**  
âœ… **Checkpoint confirmations**  
âœ… **Real-time chat interface**  
âœ… **Loan application example**  
âœ… **Extensible architecture**  

## ðŸ†˜ **Troubleshooting**

### **MongoDB Connection Issues**
- Ensure MongoDB is running: `mongod`
- Check connection string in `backend/.env`
- For cloud MongoDB, update `MONGODB_URI`

### **Port Conflicts**
- Backend runs on port 5000
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- Update ports in `.env` if needed

### **Dependencies Issues**
```bash
# Clean install
npm run clean
npm run install:all
```

## ðŸ“ž **Support**
